# Quick summery on TRON (ep-03) 

## In this post we will get deeper in bandwidth and energy

TRON Bandwidth and TRON Energy are the two key resources that can help users earn more TRX tokens by freezing their digital assets in the TRX wallet and also is important for users in creating and operating smart contracts..

Bandwidth and Energy are drived from freezing tokens for a specific amount of time so it disables you from trading, buying, or selling TRX tokens until the time they unfreeze.

### Bandwidth   

TRON bandwidth helps you perform transactions without gas fees as I've covered in the last episode but it also gives you the privilege of casting votes for electing TRON Super Representatives which I leave a practical link at the end of this post to freez tron and affix yourself to the TRON community as an active member. 

### Energy  

TRON energy is used to process the smart contracts. By sufficient Energy contracts get processed rapidly and there are no hindrances in moving your TRX tokens from one end to another.

*you can earn Energy and Bandwidth by freezing TRX which the tutorial is [here](https://youtu.be/CJN7hfX8m3A)*  

It is important to learn that TRON Bandwidth serves the purpose of sending TRX tokens where you can freeze the Bandwidth to gain more Energy. Meanwhile, TRON Energy is used for running smart contracts. Hence, both resources, TRON Bandwidth and TRON Energy, are interconnected with each other. While using TRON dApps, it is advised not to run out of Energy as one burned TRON Energy can cost approximately 1.3 TRX tokens. Transferring TRC10 tokens consumes Bandwidth while the transfer of TRC20, which are smart contract-compatible tokens, takes up Bandwidth as well as Energy.[(here's the source for this paragraph;))](https://www.namecoinnews.com/tron-bandwidth-and-energy/)

So that's it for Energy and Bandwith, next we'd go through accounts..
